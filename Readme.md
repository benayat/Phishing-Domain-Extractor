# Phishing Domain Extractor

This project uses Spring Batch to extract domain names and URLs from Phishtank, and phishing.database databases and reported phishing links, and write them to a MongoDB database.

## Spring Batch

Spring Batch is a framework for building batch processing applications in Java. It provides a set of reusable components for reading, processing, and writing large volumes of data. Spring Batch is designed to handle complex processing scenarios, such as processing data in parallel, retrying failed operations, and handling transactions.

In this project, we use Spring Batch to read data from two different sources (a JSON file and a text file), process the data to extract domain names and URLs, and write the data to a MongoDB database. We define three steps in our batch job:

1. `jsonToDtoStep`: Reads data from the `verified_online.json` file, processes it using the `phishtankProcessor`, and writes the results to a JSON file using the `jsonFileItemWriter`.

2. `phishtankStep`: Reads data from the JSON file created in the previous step, processes it using the `phishtankProcessor`, and writes the results to a MongoDB database using the `writer`.

3. `phishingDatabaseStep`: Reads data from the `All-phishing-links.txt` file, processes it using the `phishingDatabaseProcessor`, and writes the results to the same MongoDB database using the `writer`.

Each step consists of a reader, a processor, and a writer. The reader reads data from a source (in this case, a file), the processor processes the data (in this case, extracting domain names and URLs), and the writer writes the results to a destination (in this case, a JSON file or a MongoDB database).

## Installation

To install and run this project, you'll need to have Java and Maven installed on your system. You'll also need to have a MongoDB instance running.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-domain-extractor.git
```

2. Build the project:

```
cd phishing-domain-extractor
mvn clean package
```

3. Run the project:

```
java -jar target/phishing-domain-extractor-1.0.jar
```

## Usage

When you run the project, it will read the `verified_online.json` file and the `All-phishing-links.txt` file, extract the domain name and URL for each entry, and write this data to a MongoDB database.

You can modify the MongoDB connection settings in the `application.properties` file.
